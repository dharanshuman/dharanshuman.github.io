  -When 
  -we
    -Viba & I had
  -started this, we had no idea how big the space of mentorship was going to become.
  -It was a lot 
   -It became clear to us that it was a tall order for
  - for two college kids to handle.
  - Lots of things changed.
    -My cofounder, Viba, left 4 months after we launched.
    -I‚Äôll always be grateful, because Command+J wouldn‚Äôt be a reality without her.
  - As I struggled to keep the lights on by myself and improve the platform based on your feedback, the pandemic happened.
  -<br>
  -<br>

  -After months of
  -contemplation,
    -thinking about what a sustainable future for the platform could be...
  -I
  -formed a new team.
    -decided to put together a team and treat Command+J more like an organization than a school project. 
  -With this incredible team of volunteers,
  -we set out to rethink the platform.
    -we poured our hearts into evolving Command+J beyond a passion project. We listened to your feedback, revamped our branding, and rallied exceptional mentors.
  -Along with lots of luck in navigating the pandemic's uncertainties.
  -<br>
  -<br>

  -Unfortunately our
  -luck ran out just a couple of days before our launch.
    -luck ran out just a couple of days before our launch. We faced unforeseeable hurdles that, despite our best efforts, disrupted our stride.
  -We rescheduled.
  -We made changes 
    -We prioritized health and mental well being‚Ä¶ 
  -and eventually did launch.
  -But
    -, but something had changed. Call it nazar, call it a domino effect‚Ä¶ But one thing after the other,
  -things out of our control just kept going horribly wrong.
  -<br>
  -<br>
  -Initially I felt like we failed.
    -For the longest time I carried around this feeling that it had failed, and kept being extremely harsh on myself.
  -But over time, I came to realize that success isn't measured solely by the outcome.
  -The goal with Command+J wasn‚Äôt money or fame. 
  -I simply wanted
    -I had always told myself - if by making something that didn‚Äôt exist before, I‚Äôm able 
  -to make a positive impact in <b>just one person‚Äôs</b> life. That would be a win for me.
  -<br>
  -<br>
  -The platform ended up helping a
  -school kid,
    -get into NID,
  -gave an aspiring automobile designer
  -hope,
    -hope that they too can have a career in India,
  -gave a fashion designer
  -inspiration,
    -a chance to talk with a mentor who showcased their work at Lake Fashion Week, 
  -or an industrial designer
  -a role model!
    -a way to talk to people who won red dot awards! 
  -In my eyes, we more than succeeded.
  -<br>
  -<br>
  -Your stories have been the 
  -driving force behind our efforts.
    -the driving force behind our efforts. There were days that we almost wanted to give up, but excerpts from informal interviews with y'all about our impact kept us going.
  -If you have a story to share, please reply to this email. We'd love to hear from you.
  -<br>
  -<br>
  -I‚Äôm so proud of <a href=‚Äùhttps://cmdplusj-web.azurewebsites.net/about/‚Äù> all of the people</a> involved in the project who did what we could given the circumstances (including this tight <a href=‚Äùhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VzhagUtdh0‚Äù> 1min video</a>.) 
  -I‚Äôm also really proud that the problem we were trying to solve was 
  -such a real one. 
    -such a real one.
    -Before mentorship platforms became popular, 
      -While lots of mentorship platforms (like ADPList) have launched since Command+J,
    -we were the first to do this for Indian designers across all fields of design, not just UX. 
  -To think that
  -two college kids,
    -Viba and I, two college kids,
  -conceptualized and executed this during a summer break, is crazy to me.
  -<br>
  -<br>
  -Our original mission
    -We wanted to provide a platform for mentorship across all fields of design¬†(Textile, Animation, Automobile etc.), and focus primarily on
    -Indian mentors. 
      -Indian mentors. There are lots of people worldwide who "made it". But,¬†it feels¬†more achievable to see someone
      -you identify with
        -who looks like you, and grew up in conditions similar to yours ‚Äî and then
      -"make it‚Äù. 
    -Despite the millions of $ in valuation this sector has raised, this
  -is still an¬†extremely important and unmet need for junior designers and students in India. I hope we see more innovation in this space.
