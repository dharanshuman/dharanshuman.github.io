   -making life more meaningful by

  -<br>
  -<br>

  -Thank you for
  -loving all of me.
   -loving all of me â€” the sunshine, and the rain.
   -Thank you for your
   -patience
    -warmth and enormous amounts of affection, when it comes to dealing
   -with me.
  -<br>
  -<br>

  -A
  -beautiful woman...
   -beautiful woman doesn't come close to describing the
   -literal
    -literal (and I really mean <b>literally</b>, like... look at yourself!!!)
   -angel that you are.
  -<br>
  -<br>
  -But also such a
  -kind,
   -kind human being. Don't think it goes unnoticed, all the
   -things you do.
    -acts of kindness you manifest in ways others might not.
   -I know because I've looked into
   -your eyes,
    -the beautiful ocean the lives in your eyes,
   -and seen your
  -caring
   -thoughtful,
    -thoughtfulness in every action,
   -attentive
    -attention to everything important
   -and
   -affectionate
    -affection to my
  -soul.
  -<br>
  -<br>
  -i just want you to know that
  -i see you,
   -i see you.
   -When you
   -take on so much weight on your shoulders but
    -had to grow up much sooner than you wanted to, and still
   -never complain,
   -i see you,
    -i see you.
    -When you push yourself to become the best version of yourself you can be,
    -i see you,
     -i see you.
     -When you console me even when you've got your own shit to figure out,
     -i see you...
      -i see you and am grateful for you,
  -<br>
  -<br>
  -all of you,
   -every
   -bit
    -square inch
   -of your
   -mind, body and soul...
    -mind.
     -mind... I'm infatuated by the
     -way you think.
      -way your brain connects dots and how even losing myself in your mind,
      -feels like a traveller finally coming home.
    -Your body.
     -Your body, which will forever
     -strike me with awe
      -turn me into Shakespear and make me write a ballad about sundresses
     -every single time.
    -Your soul.
     -Your soul, the only thing capable of
     -making me cry
      -making me cry at the most random places,
     -out of
     -sheer happiness.
      -an overwhelming amount of
      -emotion.
       -happiness, appreciation and affection.
  -<br>
  -<br>
  -and
  -i love you
   -i love you so much, it hurts my chest. I want
   -to hug you
    -to hug you, touch you and have you in my arms. I want to let you know how much I care for you
  -with every cell in my body.
